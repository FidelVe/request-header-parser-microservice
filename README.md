# Request Header Microservice

This is an example of a microservice built with nodejs and express. The project is based of one of the [FreeCodeCamp back-end final projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/request-header-parser-microservice) and is composed of an express server hosting a default index page at root and a `/api/whoami` route that responds with a json objects showing miscellaneous info shown in the request header.

Live version of the microservice can be found [here.](https://request-header-microservice-12.herokuapp.com/)
